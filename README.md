# Programming a DFA
## Purpose
One of the Deterministic Finite Automatons applications is the implementation of a token recognizer in a programming language (Also known as a Lexer in compilers).

#### Token Types
* Integer
* Float (Real Numbers)
* Operators
  * Assignation
  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Multiplication
  * Division
  * Power
* Identifier
  * Variable
* Special Symbol
  * (
  * ) 
* Comments
## Information
#### Programming Language
Python

#### Instructions
1. Download Python
2. Download the Zip File
3. Decompress the Zip File
4. You can modify the txt.file 

#### Approach
I decided to tackle the DFA with a transition table using dictionaries in python. This way I could easily traverse the states and work directly with my diagram and transition table. By using conditionals, y moved through each state and managed to solve the DFA.

#### Example
b=7

a = 32.4 *(-8.6 - b)/       6.1E-8

d = a ^ b // Esto es un comentario

#### Results
